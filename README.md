Hit at Moment: A Thrilling Rhythm Game

Hit at Moment is a rhythm game designed to offer an exciting and challenging gaming experience. It employs a simple yet addictive concept: select your favorite song and follow the beat of the music by pressing the F and J keys on your keyboard. The F key is used for an "upslash" (an upward swing), while the J key is used for a "downslash" (a downward swing).

How to Play:

Choose a Song: Explore the available music library and pick the song you want to play.
Follow the Beat: As the music starts, pay attention to the musical notes descending from the right of the screen.
Press the Buttons: When the musical note reaches the attack point, press either the F or J key according to the direction indicated by the note.
Achieve High Scores: The more notes you hit accurately and on time, the higher your score will be.
